<h1>Welcome to <b><?php echo CHtml::encode(Yii::app()->name); ?></b></h1>

<p>Welcome to our brand new website!!<br>
We are DataKae! and our goal is to collect as much match data from Smash tourneys from all over the world.
We want to become THE place to research what you can do to improve your games, what rulesets are the
most fair and all kinds of other stuff. Our mascot squirrel will certainly have hoarded all of the data you need, so
dont keep waiting on this page. Go DataKae! </p>
